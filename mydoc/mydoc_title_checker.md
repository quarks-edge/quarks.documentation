To make sure your page titles match the sidebar titles, there's a file called "title-checker.html." After your site builds, view this file in your browser. It will tell if you any of your page titles don't match up with your sidebar titles.

This utility isn't 100% comprehensive, though. If your sidebar has a URL that doesn't match any file name in your project, it won't be able to handle that URL. Therefore, when you do validity checks for the links on your site, click through each item in the sidebar to make sure the page loads.
