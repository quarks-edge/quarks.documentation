# Get Involved with Quarks

Welcome to the Quarks community!  We would love to have you participate as a user of Quarks, a contributor or both.

## Contribute Code

If you plan to make any significant contribution, you will need to have a Contributor License Agreement [(CLA)](https://github.com/quarks-edge/quarks/blob/master/licences/Quarks-cla-individual.pdf) on file.  Get a copy of the CLA, fill it out and follow the instructions in the CLA to file it.  Committers will require a CLA before they commit contributions.

When you are considering a code contribution, make sure there is an [Issue](https://github.com/quarks-edge/quarks/issues) that describes your work or the bug you are fixing.  For significant contributions, please discuss your proposed changes in the Issue so that others can comment on your plans.  Someone else may be working on the same functionality, so it's good to communicate early and often.  A committer is more likely to accept your change if there is clear information in the Issue.  

The best way to start on the code is to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) Quarks and make changes in your fork.  When you're happy with the changes in your fork, issue a [pull request](https://github.com/quarks-edge/quarks/pulls).  Make sure you document your code and contribute tests along with the code.

We welcome new committers.  Get information on committers [here](committers).

## Contribute Documentation for the Web Site

Contributing documentation is similar to contributing code.  Follow the instructions in the Contribute Code Section above.  If you are submitting documentation for the web site, you will need to use Markdown and Jekyll to develop your web pages.
